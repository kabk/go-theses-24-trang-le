      <p>I would like to write about loneliness as a feeling that has a home within me, but also extends into a collective common ground. Moving between interludes of personal writing and theoretical analysis, I want to write about it in a way that both reveals how it feels, but also gives an insight into its reasonings. To give an insight into how loneliness is never individual, but how it takes its form as a public feeling enforced by societal influences.</p>

      <p>My first encounter with solitude was when I was five years old. I woke up in the middle of the night and the nightlight on the wall caught my attention. The dim light was the only living creature of the night. Between dream and reality, I believed I was sleeping next to my grandmother in her bed surrounded by the ultimate tranquillity created by the golden light. Having grown up, I today notice that I am still seeking this particular notion everywhere and in everything I create as a visual creator.</p><br/>
      <p>But at the time I was still growing up, I did not know such feelings would later still stay with me. At the time I was still living in Vietnam, I did not predict my relationship to solitude would change. Back then I was comfortable with being alone. However, when I moved to the Netherlands, the feeling of solitude transformed into something else. Something I would today rather name as loneliness. This transformation of a feeling led me to writing and researching the topic of loneliness. I wanted to understand how being alone felt different to me depending on where I lived.</p><br/>
      <p>I begin my thesis with an aim of defining what loneliness is and how being alone can manifest itself differently in the form of solitude and/or urban loneliness. Writing personal interludes and analysing an artwork serve as a method of revealing how loneliness feels and how it can be interpreted outside academic theory and statistics. In the end, I look upon loneliness as directly connected to migration and the reasonings behind such connections on a personal and theoretical level.</p>

      <!-- <p>From songs to poems and from music to literature, one encounters tunes and words that engage with being lonely in one way or another. What is the difference? And what is loneliness in fact?</p> -->
      <p>In an article published in 1981, Daniel Perlman and Letitia Anne Peplau define loneliness as <i>“a subjective, unwelcome sense of lacking or losing companionship”</i>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Perlman, Daniel and Peplau, Letitia Anne: ‘Toward a Social Psychology of Loneliness’, in Personal Relationships: 3. Relationships in Disorder, London: Academic Press, 1981. p. 32.
      </span></span> It’s a feeling that arises when there is an imbalance between the quantity and quality of the social relationships we do have and the ones we desire. But there is a difference between an absence of intimacy within relationships and an embraced time spent alone. A difference Stephanie Dowrick makes a distinction between, as she defines one as loneliness and another as solitude. She frames solitude as being <i>“reasonably comfortable with your own self”</i>, while she defines loneliness as a feeling of being <i>“uncomfortably alone without someone.”</i><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Dowrick, Stephanie: ‘Intimacy and Solitude’, London: The Women’s Press, 1992. p.141.
      </span></span></p><br/>
      <p>Loneliness and solitude emerge differently in different places; feelings that can be general ones, yet are culturally arranged. Thích Nhất Hạnh<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Thích Nhất Hạnh was a Vietnamese Thiền Buddhist monk, peace activist, prolific author, poet and teacher, who, after getting exiled from Vietnam for refusing to support war on both sides, founded the Plum Village Tradition, historically recognized as the main inspiration for engaged Buddhism. Known as the ‘father of mindfulness’, Nhất Hạnh was a major influence on Western practices of Buddhism. Wikipedia. accessed 28 January 2024.
      </span></span> elaborates further on the feeling of loneliness as a feeling that is embedded in cultural changes.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Hạnh, Thích Nhất: ‘Phần 02: Cô đơn, Nói voi tuổi 20’, Lá Bối, 1966.
      </span></span></p><br/>
      <p>In the book <i>“Nói với tuổi 20”</i> published in 1966, Thích Nhất Hạnh blames social regulation and cultural transition along with the stupidity of young adults in Vietnam for their loneliness.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid.
      </span></span> Splendidly walking out of the war, Vietnam was holistically destroyed. People attempted to build up society while trying to maintain traditional values and catching up with an ever-changing globalisation. This transition resulted in a generational conflict, as parents tried to teach their children outdated values and traditions, while a younger generation was deeply influenced by the new Eastern Western culture. A friction that led to a societal split between generations within a family; resulting in younger people rebelling against an older generation and what they considered outdated values.</p><br/>
      <p>It seems that isolation as a feeling arose, as people were caught up in an individual chase of profitable success or as family structures and collective group systems dismantled in the process of a more 'modern' society. A process Thích Nhất Hạnh named <i>“guồng máy”</i> referring to an industrialization of society. Yet an industrialization of society is not only present in Vietnamese history. Within the European context, the use of the term loneliness began increasing after 1800 with the Industrial Revolution.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Hill, Samantha: ‘Where loneliness can lead’, AEON, 2020, accessed 28 January 2024.

      </span></span> As we shifted from agrarian societies to urban industrial ones in the early nineteenth century, such societal change resulted in a new distinctive formation of loneliness, as people left their families and homes to work in factories. A formation <i>“that was a response to the emerging competitive individualism of modern life.”</i><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid.

  <div class="post">
    <p>In my thoughts and within my being, loneliness resembles an empty expansion enclosed by the bounds of an unending circle. This space is enveloped in a white (sometimes grey) fog, perhaps too dense to discern anything beyond the void. It could be that the expanse is equivalent to just 19 square metres.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">My room in Den Haag, the Netherlands.
      </span></span> When I turn 90º to the right followed by 180º to the left and then 90º to the left again, there is an absence of any sign, smell, taste or sound from other beings. Words remain unspoken, as there is no necessity for communication. I'm inclined to believe that I am truly alone in this space.</p><br/><br/>
      <p>I wonder what I look like when I feel lonely?<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It is a social norm for people (in Vietnam) to look calm and collected regardless of how you feel. So it is important to be aware of the image you create of yourself, when others look upon you.

      <p style="font-size: 2rem;">How to pretend<br> not to be lonely</p><br><br>
      
      <p><b>ONE</b> – Delude yourself with the help of the voice in<br> your head.
      Force it if needed: “You are not lonely.”</p><br/>
      <p>(Your body is now confused since it cannot lie)</p><br/>
      <p><b>TWO</b> – Repeat step one: “You are not lonely.”</p><br/>
      <p>(There is an unsettling numbing sensation starting to crawl up your spine.

      <p>“You are not lonely.”<br />
      “You are not lonely.”<br />
      “You are not lonely.”<br />
      “You are not lonely.”<br />

      “You are not lonely.”</p><br/>
      
      <p>The sensation runs from the top of your head to your forehead. It reaches and blurs your eyes. You are completely deluded. You now are able to function like a computer with standard social behaviours programmed in your hard-drive. You entirely rely on your memories rather than reacting upon the surrounding environment.

      <p>I avoid the temptation to go to a restaurant by myself. I notice how people sometimes eat alone in the restaurant. Most of them are accompanied by a phone. They will hold their cutlery on one hand and their phone on the other. They do look less lonely when they are occupied by something else rather than their food. Perhaps they feel less lonely or feel less in general, when they are distracted by another dimension. Cecilie told me how she in China often noticed couples eating across the table from one another, but both staring at their phones. I wonder if there is still intimacy within these intimate settings? Is it an act of being solitude with each other or an escape from mandatory interactions?</p><br/>
      <p>I would rather get take-out, then eat at home alone with my phone.

  </div>

  <div class="post overflow" style="height:500px;">
    <p>Edward Hopper finished painting titled Nighthawks in 1942. A painting portraying four people at a diner at night; a man wearing a white hat behind the bar, a woman eating, a man smoking a cigarette and a man with his back against the window. As a viewer you are left to the position of gazing through the window, as if you were passing the street late at night. An empty urban streetscape illuminated by the light provided by the diner. As the urban space is left dark, a viewer’s gaze is immediately directed towards the diner. Four people are sitting together, but even when sharing a space, a feeling of alienation and loneliness still exists, as the four of them live their own existence in a shared space, but separate and apart. Four people sit together, but their interactions are little. A woman and a man sit next to one another and even though their hands are almost touching, they are not. A key indicator of being together, yet also not, as they are both starring ahead of them and the only possible connection is a disconnected one.</p>
    <br/>
      <p>The colour palette of warm toned brown, orange and yellow colours together with cold tones of dark green and dark blue has a similarity to Vincent Van Gogh’s painting The Night Cafe. A painting that historically has been known for using a similar colour palette that gave an <i>“illusion of vibration and dissonance within the space.”</i><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Rose, Michael, ‘Looking at Vincent Van Gogh’s The Night Café’, Michael Rose fine art, 2019, accessed 1 February 2024.
    <a href=https://www.michaelrosefineart.com/blog/2019/9/30/looking-at-vincent-van-goghs-the-night-cafe>https://www.michaelrosefineart.com/</a>
    </span></span></p><br>
    <p></p>
    <p>Within his paintings, Edward Hopper often touches upon similar topics of urban living, as he routinely reproduced <i>“certain kinds of spaces and spatial experiences common in New York that result in being physically close to others but separated from them by a variety of factors including movement, structures, windows, walls and light or darkness.”</i><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Observations by Whitney curator Carter Foster.
    </span></span> Yet according to himself, it was never a conscious choice of wanting to depict a certain experienced alienation. Instead he phrases it as <i>"unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.”</i> Nighthawks is one of his many paintings depicting the loneliness of a large city. Hopper points out how it might not have been a direct conscious choice, but Nighthawks was painted in 1942 in the years following the Great Depression.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Money, Britannica, ‘Great Depression’, accessed 1 February 2024.<br />
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/Great-Depression">https://www.britannica.com/money/Great-Depression</a>
    </span></span> But 1942 was also the year, where the US involvement in World War II was at its highest.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Zappella Christine, ‘Wartime alienation, Hopper’s Nighthawks’, accessed 03 February 2024.

    </span></span> As a painting, Nighthawks is therefore socially conditioned and reveals socio-political layers of society at a time of alienation, where the economy was recovering and women and men were sent to war.</p>

    <br />
    <h2><sup>a</sup> A CONTEMPORARY NIGHTHAWKS</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Nighthawks is a painting from 1942, but the relationship between urban space and loneliness is still present today. Urban spaces are full of people, as more and more choose to move to cities. Today 56% of the whole population on Earth live in cities.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">‘Urban Development’, The World Bank, accessed 3 February 2024.
    </span></span> But a collective movement of moving to cities does not guarantee togetherness and collectivism.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Urban loneliness is a term that describes lonely individuals living in cities; an intersection between a mental state and the built environment. A phenomenon that Barbara Taylor describes as rooted in the alienating and estranging nature of modern society. To Taylor, the pace of technological innovations have come to redefine the way we live, work and play. And so it has come to redefine and distinguish our current century from previous ones. Simultaneously, such pace of innovations has led to a career-focused and fast-paced lifestyle in urban cities leading to us spending less time together, spending less time on maintaining our relationships and forming less bonds with other people as well.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>In the past, individuals depended on tribalism and organic social connections that naturally formed within small groups rather than larger societies. There has been a shift from living in suburban settings, where the emphasis was on residing in close-knit communities with kin, to embracing the urban lifestyle that glamorises sleek downtown condominiums and one-bedroom single pads. While living alone doesn't inherently imply loneliness, individuals in such situations often find themselves spending increased periods in social isolation within their homes and may lean towards solitary activities.</p>

    <br />
    <h2><sup>b</sup> AN ISOLATION LOOKING LIKE LONELINESS,<br />
    BUT HOW WILL I EVER KNOW?</h2>
    <br />

    <p>An extreme example of urban solitude is hikikomori; a form of profound social withdrawal, commonly observed in Japan. A kind of migration away from the city. As a term it was coined in 1998 by Japanese psychiatrist Tamaki Saito.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Like many named social syndromes, Tamaki Saito’s Hikikomori defines this specific social behaviour by observing the appearance of the syndrome. The problem is when people, informed by psychiatrists, statistics and media, acknowledge Hikikomori as a mental issue while it is proved unlisted as a mental issue scientifically. In a blogpost from Hikipos.com–a site where people living as Hikikomori share their life experiences, one blogger mentioned “the journalists have been unnecessarily agitating the 8050 issue(*), causing anxiety to the people involved and their families”. The problem of Hikikomori is not only about the person who chooses to seclude themselves from the society but also the society decides to exclude them. On a TV program by NHK, Vosot Ikeida, a Hikikomori activist, mentioned: “Hikikomori is not someone to be talked about, but to talk”.<br />
      <br />
      (*8050 Issue: Issued by Japan government–One of the main social/economic problems caused by the ageing of hikikomori in Japan. It refers to the problem that arises in a family with hikikomori, of which parents are in their 80's and children are in their 50's.)<br />

      </span></span> The term involves adolescents and young adults who become reclusive in their parents’ homes, refuse to attend school or work for months or even years at a time.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>In 2021 statistics show that almost 1.5 million people of working age (1 of 50 Japanese) in Japan live like hikikomori according to the Japanese Cabinet Office.

      </span></span> However, the primary nexus of hikikomori revolves around the transition from youth to the responsibilities and expectations of adulthood. As many modern East Asian societies, Japan bears the social conditions of anomie<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In sociology, anomie is a social condition defined by an uprooting or breakdown of any moral values, standards or guidance for individuals to follow.<br />

It appears that advanced industrialised societies, like modern Japan, struggle to offer sufficient meaningful transformation rituals to guide youth into mature roles.</p><br/>
      <p>Having gone so much in depth with the term hikikomori, getting lost in the internet’s ocean of information, I started questioning why I was so fascinated by the term. What were my research urges? I asked myself. I came to some kind of conclusion that deep down my motivation lied in the curiosity of whether or not people living like hikikomori felt lonely. If their aloneness was a solitude or despair from a social life. I did not come to a conclusion and sometimes there is no such thing as a fixed conclusion – especially of the emotional kinds. How would I ever know as an outsider, if someone else from an outside carried a certain loneliness?</p><br/>
      <p>Even within statistics, the term hikikomori mostly remains within numbers. Every study is very limited, when people living like hikikomori made a choice of denying all contact. Yet even within the studies that do remain, an emotional kind of research is limited. How would researchers with the purpose of making statistics ever fully know, if they never lived like them?</p><br/>
      <p>Not only did I come across statistics and numbers in my search online, but I also ended up finding a variety of different communities of people feeling lonely and living as hikikomori online. People that formed communities online, when they felt lonely offline. I mentioned my interest in hikikomori to my friend and to my surprise, she immediately knew of it and showed me a whole group of more than 500.000 members existing on VK.com<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">VK is a Russian online social media and social networking service based in Saint Petersburg.

      <p>I might never know if those people feel lonely or how it feels to live like them, but coming across such communities online, I can only interpret that even when living like hikikomori, people still seem to desire some social contact in one form or another. And even when living socially isolated offline, people still form a community around such isolation online.</p>

    The piece is officially named "Cage Piece", is a seminal artwork by Tehching Hsieh, an immigrant artist from Taiwan. Created in 1978, the piece involved Hsieh living inside a wooden cage in his loft apartment in New York City for a whole year. The cage measured only about 11.5 feet by 9 feet, and Hsieh documented his experiences through photographs and written records. As an immigrant, Hsieh grappled with themes of confinement, isolation, and the search for personal freedom, which are evident in his performance art. "Cage Piece" reflects Hsieh's exploration of the limits of human endurance and the impact of physical and psychological constraints on the individual. Through this piece, he invites viewers to contemplate the nature of existence and the societal structures that confine us, both physically and metaphorically.

One day, Punpun falls in love at first sight with a transfer student, Aiko Tanaka, who comes to his class. Punpun heard from her that “Earth will soon become an uninhabitable planet'' and “Humanity will die if we don't move to another planet,'' and in his “Dream for the Future'' essay that was submitted today, Punpun decided to write, “I want to be a person who studies space.''

      <p>In Vietnam, privacy is a slippery and strange concept that no one discusses verbally.</p><br>
      <p>I grew up desiring to have a door to close. For more than 20 years,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-34" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Like other typical Southeast Asian families, my parents planned to keep me in the house till I would be married to another family. If I am a boy, I will be destined to stay with my family for good.
      </span></span> I shared a room without a door with my little sister. The room was around 10 square metres. There was a queen-sized bed, two working tables and a wardrobe, in which two adults could fit. The furniture created two 40 centimetre-wide narrow paths: one led to a tiny balcony and one just wide enough to open the wardrobe without hitting the wooden bed frame.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-35" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Our home is a typical small row house.

      <p>Finally I had a door to close when I moved to The Hague. The room was 19 square metres with all furniture hand-picked from walking trips around the neighborhoods. A single bed, a sofa, a working table and a closet with three shelves. I was sitting on the edge of the bed and looking around the room I had to myself, when the emptiness kicked in. It wasn’t the tiny, shared room where I had to create multiple secret corners to hide my erotic drawings (not from my little sister but from my parents' unexpected check-ups). There was no one there for me to fight over the bed territory or throw anger at, when they invaded my privacy. In that moment I realised my individuality was not the same as the individualism I experienced in the Netherlands. My individuality was rooted deeply in a lifestyle of togetherness, where everyone cares (a little too much) about each other’s existence. My desire for privacy or space of Đen Đen only exists in the doorless 10-square-metres room.</p>

  <div class="post overflow" style="height:450px;">
    <p>Moving to a city, a foreign country; a place where I know no one from the beginning, it’s difficult to dissociate a certain loneliness with being new in a new place. Meeting people stay within institutional and paid spaces and to enter any has a prize of capital; not only your living space, but also educational and institutional ones. We pay to be together, or if we do not pay, we get paid by spending our time in a working space. Time has been labelled a capital and wherever we move through, some kind of capital has been involved. Even socialising and being in a togetherness today involves an exchange of capital, as we pay when we drink a coffee with our friend and as we form relationships by moving through paid educational spaces.</p><br>
    <p>In the book ‘Cruel Optimism’, Laurent Berlant starts her writing with: “A relation of cruel optimism exists when something you desire is actually an obstacle to your flourishing.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-42" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Berlant, Laurent: “Cruel Optimism”, Duke University Press 2011, p. 10.
    </span></span> A desire for things that are bad for us; whether such desire is smoking, a kind of toxic love, a fantasy of ‘the good life’ or subjects that on a surface promise you some kind of improvement of living. But Berlant states these relations are not directly cruel, but “they become cruel only when the object that draws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-43" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-43" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid.    </span></span></p><br>
    <p>In Vietnam where I am from, a certain internalised racism exists, as standards are measured by Europeanness and moving to Europe is portrayed as some kind of idealised improvement of living. As such, leaving where you are from to pursue a dream of another living, is what Berlant would consider a cruel optimism.</p><br>
    <p>Sara Ahmed points towards a relationship between a promise of happiness, an unhappy racism and migration in her book ‘The Promise of Happiness'.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-44" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-44" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ahmed, Sara: “The Promise of Happiness”, Duke University Press 2010.
    </span></span> A certain societal standard of happiness is what directs us towards making certain decisions in life. But when it comes to the standardised idea of happiness, one question remains:</p>
    <p>Whose standards are we measuring happiness by?</p><br>
    <p>Sara Ahmed points to how happiness as a mission is a colonial mission, where a native culture perceived as miserable serves as justification for colonial missions:</p><br>
    <p><em>“For happiness to become a mission, the colonised other must first be deemed unhappy. The imperial archive can be considered as an archive of unhappiness. Colonial knowledges constitute the other as not only an object of knowledge, a truth to be discovered, but as being unhappy, as lacking the qualities or attributes required for a happier state of existence.”</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-45" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-45" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid, p. 125.
    </span></span></p><br>
    <p>According to Ahmed, colonialism is justified as a happiness mission of redirecting people to a dominant culture. So, the colonial project is a redirection that is justified as ‘teaching people how to be happy’. But happiness is not only measured by a dominant colonial culture, it is also a binder for nationhood, as Ahmed mentions how “happiness is still used as a technology of citizenship, as a way of binding migrants to a national ideal. To be bound to happiness is to be bound by what has already been established as good.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-46" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-46" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid, p. 133.    </span></span></p>

    <p>Having left the country, from which I am from, I am now questioning the reasons why I left besides the 'better' education. But my own reasoning is never that individual. Having written about loneliness as a public feeling and as a result of migration the past few weeks, I now see patterns between my own feelings and societal movements like urban loneliness. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>One question is: Why did I leave?</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Another question is: Why do people in general leave? People move from one place to another with the desire for the ‘better’. A standardised idea of what a happy life is supposed to look like – often in close relationship with a financial desire for a practical improvement of living. Laurent Berlant stated that things we desire that end up being an obstacle for our happiness are a kind of cruel optimism. Maybe me leaving Vietnam was such a cruel optimism. But such a leaving is attached to a bigger societal picture. Sara Ahmed pointed to the concept of a promise of happiness. How certain objects and subjects carry a promise of happiness, but how such are political. People leaving where they are from, is never neutral, as the desire for what has been established as good and the happy life is never neutral.</p><br>
    <p>I researched different kinds of loneliness in the form of solitude, urban loneliness and hikikomori as one example of such. Urban loneliness and hikikomori both being the results of some kind of migration. But reading about something is different from living it and therefore feeling it. I will never know from second sources how people feel, but I do recognize the patterns of how even people make a choice of either isolation or leave where they are from, it can never be separated from people still carrying a social need for contact in one form or another.</p>
    <p>Loneliness might often be perceived as an individual private feeling, but researching it and writing about it, I now see it as having a collective common ground. Loneliness is never fully alone. In the end, it’s a public feeling imposed by societal impacts.</p>

    <p>Sonya told me: <i>“When I was travelling alone, I realised that I really like to be alone somewhere else, because I can decide everything for myself. I don’t have to compromise with anyone. But at the same time this realisation makes me feel quite sad about being alone, because I don’t have anyone to share this experience with. I don’t have anyone to share this memory with. So it makes me feel like the memory can only exist, when you share it with someone else, because then there is always another person reminding you that something happened. If you are alone and you forget something, then it’s gone forever.”</i></p><br><br>
    <p>There was an unwanted poignant longing invaded my ribcage territory while I was listening to Sonya telling me about her travel from The Hague to Berlin. I found it profoundly sad, because the story came from a cheerful warm-hearted Sonya. Did she meet anyone on her way? And did those people fail to enter her heart? I see myself in her eyesight filled with joy and emptiness; missing someone that does not exist. A forgotten memory leaves a void with a peculiar sadness. This sadness is a yearning for the lost. To keep yearning is to keep desiring what one does not even remember one had in the first place, as the memory was lost. One continues to create memories and fails to maintain it. Loneliness becomes a moulded vessel, which we silently preserve for someone else.</p><br>
    <p>In the middle of the class meeting, Diana texted me: <i>“a cold empty feeling in your chest, it's being on the beach on a gloomy day and ur skin exposed to the wind.”</i></p><br>
    <p>Diana mentioned the cold (no)thing nesting in her chest. She was on the beach, when the sky turned grey and the wind touched her skin. I pondered whether the chill on her skin, exposed to the wind, mirrored the cold void within her chest. For a moment, I couldn't comprehend. I asked her if she wanted to talk more about it. She agreed. However, we never mentioned it again.</p>
