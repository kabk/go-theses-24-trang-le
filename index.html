      <p>Balcony is a personal space containing your calm and collectedness. Balcony is a relatively small open space where you are allowed to feel comfortable with yourself/with whom you are comfortable enough to invite into your territory. You access a balcony for the open air to clear up your head. Thus you step outside to bring yourself back inward. While window just suggests you an idea of the outside world, balcony invites you to experience the world yourself without completely engage into it. </p>

      <p>However, to the strangers on the street, balcony is a fascinating pop-up stage that they habitually gaze up to to satisfy their curiosity. Whatever the owner do: sitting, reading, smoking, or simply standing, their activities represent a glimpse of the life the stranger will never live in. 

        This archive of balconies everywhere across the continents presents the tension between privacy of balconyâ€™s owner and the gazes of the strangers passing by the balcony.
